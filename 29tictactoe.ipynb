    "# 29. Tic Tac Toe Game\n",
    "\n",
    "From [PracticePython.org](https://www.practicepython.org/exercise/2016/08/03/29-tic-tac-toe-game.html):\n",
    ">In 3 previous exercises, we built up a few components needed to build a Tic Tac Toe game in Python:\n",
    "1. [Draw the Tic Tac Toe game board](https://www.practicepython.org/exercise/2014/12/27/24-draw-a-game-board.html)\n",
    "2. [Checking whether a game board has a winner](https://www.practicepython.org/exercise/2015/11/16/26-check-tic-tac-toe.html)\n",
    "3. [Handle a player move from user input](https://www.practicepython.org/exercise/2015/11/26/27-tic-tac-toe-draw.html)\n",
    ">\n",
    ">The next step is to put all these three components together to make a two-player Tic Tac Toe game! Your challenge in this exercise is to use the functions from those previous exercises all together in the same program to make a two-player game that you can play with a friend. There are a lot of choices you will have to make when completing this exercise, so you can go as far or as little as you want with it."
