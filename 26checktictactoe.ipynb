    "# 26. Check Tic Tac Toe\n",
    "\n",
    "From [PracticePython.org](https://www.practicepython.org/exercise/2015/11/16/26-check-tic-tac-toe.html):\n",
    "    \n",
    "> This exercise is Part 2 of 4 of the Tic Tac Toe exercise series. The other exercises are: [Part 1](https://www.practicepython.org/exercise/2014/12/27/24-draw-a-game-board.html), [Part 3](https://www.practicepython.org/exercise/2015/11/26/27-tic-tac-toe-draw.html), and [Part 4](https://www.practicepython.org/exercise/2016/08/03/29-tic-tac-toe-game.html).\n",
    "> \n",
    ">As you may have guessed, we are trying to build up to a full tic-tac-toe board. However, this is significantly more than half an hour of coding, so we’re doing it in pieces.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">Today, we will simply focus on checking whether someone has WON a game of Tic Tac Toe, not worrying about how the moves were made.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">If a game of Tic Tac Toe is represented as a list of lists, like so:\n",
    "```\n",
    "game = [[1, 2, 0],\n",
    "\t    [2, 1, 0],\n",
    "\t    [2, 1, 1]]\n",
    "```\n",
    ">where a 0 means an empty square, a 1 means that player 1 put their token in that space, and a 2 means that player 2 put their token in that space.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">Your task this week: given a 3 by 3 list of lists that represents a Tic Tac Toe game board, tell me whether anyone has won, and tell me which player won, if any. A Tic Tac Toe win is 3 in a row - either in a row, a column, or a diagonal. Don’t worry about the case where TWO people have won - assume that in every board there will only be one winner."
